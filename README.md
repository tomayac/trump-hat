# `<trump-hat>` Web Component

## About Notes

This demo requires a browser with [Custom Elements v1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements) support.
Google Chrome as of [version 54](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4696261944934400) is a good choice.
On earlier versions, this feature was also implemented behind a [flag](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/customelements/),
like in older [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) versions,
where one could start Canary from the command line like so:
```bash
>$ /Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary --enable-blink-features=CustomElementsV1
```

## Live Demo

See a [live demo](https://tomayac.github.io/trump-hat/) in a supported browser (see the _About Notes_ above).

## Usage
```html
<trump-hat color="white" embroidery="Make Web Components\nGreat Again" width="250px"></trump-hat>
